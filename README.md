# Frontend-Boilerplate - Save time bootstrapping a new project
Always wanted to use a modern frontend environment but all the js-tools intimidate you? Then this project is made for you. Frontend-Boilerplate sets up a modern frontend environment with best practices already backed in. Under the hood it uses [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) to transpile ES6 to ES5, [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to bundle all your modules and [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) as a testrunner.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marvinhagemeister/frontend-boilerplate.git
```

Go into the cloned directory and install all npm dependencies:

cd frontend-boilerplate && npm install
